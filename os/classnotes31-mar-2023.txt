 also run it without using bash }}} chmod u+x hello.sh

A.  PS1 = prompt string 1 
    it will set the prompt string
	iet@DESKTOP-4DV5G8K:~/shellscripts$

Q. How to change the prompt string , how to change any environment variable  ? 
        export PS1=value
 
Q. Declare a variable in the hello.sh and print it
