Good Evening :)

Revision --- 

external fragmentation
Logical/offset address

life cycle states of a process
preemptive priority scheduling

Segment table
first fit best fit worst fit
__________________________________

Paging ---
  --- based on fixed partition scheme
  --- process division based on SIZE
  ---  every process has many pages
  	  each page has addresses from page offset 0
  --- external framentation is totally removed
  ---internal fragmentation
  ---pages are tracked using page table
  ---page table has 2 column ---page number and frame number
   --- Very large page table size !!!
   --- page table management is additional overhead
   	  --different external mechanisms are used for
   	  page table storage and search
   	  ---a cache called as TLB translation lookaside buffer   used to hold page tables 
   	  --- page tables may be maintained on hard-disk
   
   
   
   

Segmentation
  --- based on variable partition scheme
  --- process division based on CONTENT
  --- every process has many segments
  	each segment has address from 0 seg offset
  --- external fragmentation NOT completetly removed.	
  ---- no internal fragmentation
  --- segments are tracked using segment table
  --- segment table has 3 column -- segno, segment base, seg length
  --- SMALL Segment table size
  
  _______________________________________
  
  Actual address in paging =  
  	Program counter has==?Page number, Page offset of the next instruction
  	
  	|
  	|
  	|
  	Kernel picks up pagenumber 
  	|
  	|
  	|
  	REFER to page table and find frame number
  	|
  	|
  	|
  	Find the frame base address 
  	
  ACTUAL ADDRESS = FRAME BASE + PAGE OFFSET
  	
 _____________________________________________
 
 Paged Segmentation !!!  First process is divided into segments and each segment is divided into pages!!!

 Scenario 3 --- Partial process is loaded
 		@ Non consecutive locations	
  	
  What are the problems in loading Full process ?
  1. Process size cannot exceed RAM size .
  2. Unneccessary pages are loaded
  3. Degree of Multiprogramming is reduced
  	
  	Degree of Multiprogramming= number of processes loaded in RAM at any given time 
  	
 __________________________
 Shell Scripting ----------
 
 What is SHELL ?  CLI program
 Which is default shell ? bash 
 how to see the current shell ? echo $SHELL 
 
 how to print and add new line ? echo "message"
 how to suppress new line while printing ?
   echo -n "message"
   
 how to accept values in a variable ??
   read x y z
   
 We can run commands directly in the script
 how to add 2 integers ?  expr $x + $y
 how to include expr in a statement ? back tick
   sum=`expr $x + $y`
   
 how to set environment variable ?  
 	export PS1="h1>>"
 	
 Structural statements in shell script ---
   how to give a condition in shell script ? 
   	operand1  operator  operand2
 	
 	relational operators for numbers =
 	  -lt , -gt , -ge , -le ,-eq ,-ne
 	
 	relational operators for strings =
 	   ==  , !=
 	   
 	unary operators = SINGLE OPERAND
 		-d  = is it a directory
 		-f = is it a file
 		-z = is the string empty 
 	   
 	   
 	   
 	
EX1 --- ask the user to enter a number and tell whether it is divisible by 5


EX2 ----  accept a number from user and tell whether it is less than equal or greater than 100.	
 	
EX3 --- show a menu to the user
1. add 2. subtract 3. multiply 4. divide	
accept the choice and two numbers and show the result.
 	
A) do with if elif
B) do with switch case 

_____________________________
Loops 
1. while loop
2. utill loop
3. for loop 2 variations


Ex1 --- show numbers from 1 to 50 using while loop
Ex2 --- show numbers from 1 to 50 using simple for loop , show coma separated numbers, no coma after last number
Ex1 --- show numbers from 1 to 50 using until loop 	
while loop runs -- as long as condition true
util loop runs ---as long as condition is false 
 
Ex --- using for-in  loop print the names of all files in the current folder 
   
   
Ex --- accept a name from user and tell whether it is a file or a directory  
   
 
Ex --  accept a folder name from user
	show contents of each file and folder in that folder
	
HW --- 
1. write a shellscript that accepts a number
	output
	if user enters 5
